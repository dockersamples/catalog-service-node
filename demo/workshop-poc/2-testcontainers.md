# Integration testing with Testcontainers

In this hands-on, you will use Testcontainers to run integration tests. With Testcontainers, you can leverage the power of containers, allowing you to test using real databases, real caches, and mock out other services (such as S3 or external APIs).

## Running tests

For a first pass, simply run the tests by using the following command:

```console
npm run integration-test
```
