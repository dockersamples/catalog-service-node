# Workshop PoC

This workshop will help you learn how to:

1. [Use Docker Compose to start a project](./1-compose-project)
2. [Use Testcontainers to run integration tests](./2-testcontainers)

If you are running this workshop outside of the PoC, you will need to run the `setup.sh` file found in this project.
